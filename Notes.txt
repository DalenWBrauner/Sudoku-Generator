It works an I like it! Of course, there's always more to do.
	I just recently rewrote the unsolver so all even removals are "rotationally symmetric."
	See "Entry Elimination" in http://www.longwood.edu/assets/mathematics/Team2975_ProblemB.pdf

IN PROGRESS:
	N/A	
	
THE FUTURE:	
	GUI.py
		will be any and all gui interface
	Playable.py
		will be any and all parts of the project making this a playable game
	issolvable()
		Determine whether or not a puzzle can be solved given its current blanks
	isunique()
		Determine whether or not a puzzle can be solved with strictly one solution given its current blanks

NEXT IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT:
	N/A
	
FUN FACT:
The sudoku puzzle generation process is as follows:
	Start with a very specific sample puzzle
		Current number of possible puzzles: 1
	Scramble the following list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
	So you get something like:   [3,1,7,4,6,9,8,2,5]
	Replace all 1s in the specific sample puzzle with 3s.
	Replace all 2s in the specific sample puzzle with 1s.
	Replace all 3s in the specific sample puzzle with 7s. etc.
		Number of possible replacement lists:
		9! = 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 362,880
		Current number of possible puzzles: 362,880
	Shuffle the columns of the puzzle s.t. the puzzle is still valid.
		Number of possible results from shuffling:
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the first 3 columns.
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the second 3 columns.
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the third 3 columns.
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the 3 triplets of columns.
		6^4 = 6*6*6*6 = 1296
		9! * 6^4 = 470,292,480
		Final number of possible puzzles: 470,292,480
