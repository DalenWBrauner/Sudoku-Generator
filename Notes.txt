Alright, folks, we're shaking things up again. But that's okay; we're only reshaping the
future. Nothing that has already been accomplished will change, or be destroyed. All of
your precious work shall be kept orderly, and perserved. So rest easy, my friends.
What's changed is how we're going to take what we've built and let it grow. We've learned
that what we have works well on its own, as a basic output of Answer Keys stored inside
neatly-crafted Sudoku objects. Which is great; why bog it down more than it needs to be?

Instead, we're going to turn Generator.py into Answer_Generator.py, and so we're just
going to scrap all of the main() crap that's in it now. All we're doing is scrapping what
we always knew we would scrap, just a little bit early. Now we're going to move onto a
product known as Puzzle_Unsolver.py, and that's going to take the we Answer Key we ever-
so-nicely wrapped up for it already from our Answer Key generating factory and make it
into an object that a casual user can see and attempt to solve.
We may even introduce another object, so that Answer Keys and Unsolved Puzzles can be
kept seperately. (This is useful for a variety of reasons that seem obvious to me,
chiefly the one where a user wants to see whether or not they actually solved their
puzzle correctly.)

I think this change will really impact the modularity of the project in an extremeley
positive way, which is something I really value. Being able to go back and to edit the
code with minimal effort is _very_important_ to me and I intend to stick to that.

CURRENT INTENDED FILE LAYOUT:
FINISHED:
	Puzzle.py
		Holds a functional Sudoku object.
	Answer_Generator.py
		Generates answer keys to Sudoku puzzles.
		def Column_Shuffler(puzzle)
			def Shuffle_Columns(puzzle,listOfColumns)
		def Nine_Factorial()
IN PROGRESS:	
	Answer_Unsolver.py
		will take existing Answer Keys and creates a solvable puzzle
THE FUTURE:	
	GUI.py
		will be any and all gui interface, I guess
	Playable.py
		will be the part of the project that goes to making this a playable game

NEXT IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT:
FINISH HIM

	
FUN FACT:
The sudoku puzzle generation process is as follows:
	Start with a very specific sample puzzle
		Current number of possible puzzles: 1
	Scramble the following list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
	So you get something like:   [3,1,7,4,6,9,8,2,5]
	Replace all 1s in the specific sample puzzle with 3s.
	Replace all 2s in the specific sample puzzle with 1s.
	Replace all 3s in the specific sample puzzle with 7s. etc.
		Number of possible replacement lists:
		9! = 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 362,880
		Current number of possible puzzles: 362,880
	Shuffle the columns of the puzzle s.t. the puzzle is still valid.
		Number of possible results from shuffling:
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the first 3 columns.
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the second 3 columns.
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the third 3 columns.
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the 3 triplets of columns.
		6^4 = 6*6*6*6 = 1296
		9! * 6^4 = 470,292,480
		Final number of possible puzzles: 470,292,480
