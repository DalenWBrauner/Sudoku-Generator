Okay, so we have functional Sudoku Objects,
and working functions Nine_Factorial and Column_Shuffler.
This means we are now successfully generating Answer Sheets.
Unfortunately, the pattern I thought I stamped out is still there.

NEXT IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT:
Hunt for an answer sheet without that pattern.

In case you're wondering "What pattern?", allow me to explain.
Suppose the following is a sector:
[ 7 5 8 ]
[ 1 3 6 ]
[ 9 4 2 ]
It's possible/likely that the next sector's rows will also contain
some combination of [7,5,8] some combination of [1,3,6], and some
combination of [9,4,2], such as:
[ 8 7 5 ]
[ 2 9 4 ]
[ 6 1 3 ]
or:
[ 4 2 9 ]
[ 3 6 1 ]
[ 5 8 7 ]
Any player privvy to this knowledge can use this to his or her
advantage, by noting that a 3 is always accompanied by a 1 and a 6.
This NEEDS to be stamped out promptly.

CURRENT INTENDED FILE LAYOUT:
Puzzle.py
	will hold our Sudoku object and all of its definitions, etc.
Generator.py
	will generate Sudoku object puzzles via the following functions:
	def main()
	def Puzzle_Unsolver(puzzle,difficulty)
	def Column_Shuffler(puzzle)
		def Shuffle_Columns(puzzle,listOfColumns)
	def Sample_Scrambler()
GUI.py
	will be any and all gui interface, I guess
Playable.py
	will be the part of the project that goes to making this a playable game
	
	
FUN FACT:
The sudoku puzzle generation process is as follows:
	Start with a very specific sample puzzle
		Current number of possible puzzles: 1
	Scramble the following list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
	So you get something like:   [3,1,7,4,6,9,8,2,5]
	Replace all 1s in the specific sample puzzle with 3s.
	Replace all 2s in the specific sample puzzle with 1s.
	Replace all 3s in the specific sample puzzle with 7s. etc.
		Number of possible replacement lists:
		9! = 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 362,880
		Current number of possible puzzles: 362,880
	Shuffle the columns of the puzzle s.t. the puzzle is still valid.
		Number of possible results from shuffling:
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the first 3 columns.
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the second 3 columns.
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the third 3 columns.
		6 different outcomes from shuffling the 3 triplets of columns.
		6^4 = 6*6*6*6 = 1296
		9! * 6^4 = 470,292,480
		Final number of possible puzzles: 470,292,480
